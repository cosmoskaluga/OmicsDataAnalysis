# Introduction

Today we will focus on the differential gene expression analysis to study the molecular signatures of Amyloid-β toxicity in yeast using the data obtained from GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE128905). There are 2 experimental groups of replicates: Control and Aβ42 (yeasts expressing Aβ42 peptide) with 3 replicates per group. Raw reads were already preprocessed and Salmon pseudocounts are accessible here: /home/d.smirnov/homework4/SalmonOutput
